"""
pi-drive — single source of truth for mechanical/software limits AND for
the layered per-mode caps on how much throttle a given controller is
allowed to command.

Two kinds of limit live here:

1. Hardware-side limits (pot travel, steering lock-to-lock). Driven by
   physics/mechanics — must never be violated regardless of who's
   driving. These stay mirrored in the matching C header for Arduino
   sketches, ``sketches/common/cart_limits.h`` — keep the two in sync.

2. A layered hierarchy of gas caps, by who's driving:

       GAS_POT_MAX          (hardware max — never exceed)
         ↑ always clamps
       GLOBAL_SPEED_LIMIT   (top-level, applies in EVERY mode)
         ↑ always clamps
       PS5_GAS_LIMIT        (human-driving-with-PS5-controller cap)
       FSD_GAS_LIMIT        (autonomy cap — lowest layer / most conservative)

   "Global has hierarchy over PS5" means: even if the PS5 script is told
   it can push gas to 0.9, the global cap will shrink that to
   GLOBAL_SPEED_LIMIT. "FSD sits at the lowest level" means the autonomy
   stack's own cap lives underneath everything else — it is the smallest
   number by default so robot-driving is the slowest authority tier on
   the cart.

Use ``effective_gas_cap(mode_limit)`` to resolve the cap for a given
mode — it takes ``min()`` across the hardware, global, and mode-specific
ceilings so callers can't accidentally bypass a layer above them.
