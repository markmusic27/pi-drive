# pi-drive — Architecture

How the cart's software is organized today, where it's going, and the cross-cutting rules (limits hierarchy, safety layers) that every subsystem has to respect.

For per-subsystem detail see [`steering.md`](./steering.md), [`linear_actuators.md`](./linear_actuators.md), [`estop.md`](./estop.md), [`gps.md`](./gps.md), [`imu.md`](./imu.md), [`cameras.md`](./cameras.md), and [`ps5_drive.md`](./ps5_drive.md).

## Layers

From the road up:

| Layer            | Runs on              | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Actuators        | Motors / H-bridges   | Physically move the cart (ODrive S1 steering, 2× BTS7960 linear actuators).      |
| Firmware         | Arduino Mega 2560    | Closed-loop-ish position control of both pedals, pot feedback, host heartbeat watchdog. GPS passthrough. |
| Host control     | Jetson AGX Thor (dev: MacBook) | Human + autonomy controllers. Talks USB to the ODrive, USB serial to the Mega, USB to 4 cameras. |
| Input sources    | Human or FSD         | PS5 DualSense (human) or the autonomy stack (FSD). Both produce the same commands.     |

Power is also layered — 48 V pack → dedicated 12 V and 5 V buck rails — see [`steering.md`](./steering.md#power).

### Planned

Once `ps5_drive.py` and the autonomy stack start sharing hardware wrappers, the hardware-interfacing code moves into an importable `cart/` package. `sketches/` becomes `firmware/`. Scripts become thin glue. This refactor is staged but not yet executed.

```text
cart/
├── limits.py
├── steering/controller.py         # wraps ODrive S1
├── pedals/controller.py           # wraps Mega serial + heartbeat
├── input/ps5.py                   # DualSense reader
├── cameras/{rig.py, config.py}    # opens 4 cams by logical name
└── sensors/{gps.py, imu.py}

firmware/                          # renamed sketches/
scripts/                           # CLI entrypoints, no logic
tests/                             # pytest — pure-logic coverage
```

## Cross-cutting: gas authority hierarchy

Every gas-pedal command, regardless of who's driving, is clamped by this stack (see [`limits.py`](../limits.py)):

```text
GAS_POT_MAX          hardware ceiling — the actuator physically can't go past this
  ↑ always clamps
GLOBAL_SPEED_LIMIT   project-wide governor — applies in every mode
  ↑ always clamps
PS5_GAS_LIMIT        human driving cap
FSD_GAS_LIMIT        autonomy cap (lowest layer — robot drives slower than a human by default)
```

`limits.effective_gas_cap(mode_limit)` returns `min(GAS_POT_MAX, GLOBAL_SPEED_LIMIT, mode_limit)`. Callers should never bypass this helper — lowering `GLOBAL_SPEED_LIMIT` must be sufficient to slow the whole cart down.

## Cross-cutting: safety layers

Listed in order of authority. Each lower layer assumes the ones above it may fail.

| Layer                 | Mechanism                                                                 | Failure mode caught                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware e-stop       | 48 V battery cutoff button                                                | Anything, including the Jetson catching fire      |
| Software e-stop (TBD) | NC button → Mega pin 2 INT0                                               | Passenger-reachable "please stop"                 |
| Firmware watchdog     | `pedal_control.ino` retracts both pedals if host silent for 300 ms         | USB cable yanked, host crashes, host hangs        |
| Firmware pot limits   | Hard stops at `*_POT_MIN/MAX` regardless of commanded target               | Misbehaving host, parser bugs                     |
| Host fault detection  | `PedalLink` aborts the loop on `SerialException`                          | Lost pedal link while still commanding steering   |
| Gas authority caps    | `effective_gas_cap()` — hardware / global / per-mode                      | Overzealous controller (human or robot)           |
| Steering soft limits  | `STEERING_MIN/MAX_DEG`, planner velocity/accel caps                        | Commanded angle outside mechanical lock-to-lock   |

The firmware watchdog and the host fault detection together mean: **yanking the USB cable stops the cart** even though the Mega keeps its own power. See [`linear_actuators.md`](./linear_actuators.md#combined-pedal-firmware-sketchespedal_controlpedal_controlino) for the protocol spec.

## Firmware workflow (no Arduino IDE)

`.ino` files are the Arduino IDE's native format — but they're really just C++ with a preprocessor that auto-generates prototypes and injects `#include <Arduino.h>`. We keep the extension (it's what every AVR tool expects) and drive the toolchain from the CLI via [`arduino-cli`](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/), which is what the IDE's green arrow calls under the hood.

[`scripts/upload.py`](../scripts/upload.py) wraps `arduino-cli compile` + `arduino-cli upload` so the flow is one command:

```bash
uv run python scripts/upload.py --list                       # show sketches
uv run python scripts/upload.py pedal_control                # compile + flash
uv run python scripts/upload.py pedal_control --monitor      # then open serial
uv run python scripts/upload.py pedal_control --compile-only # just build
```

Mechanics:

- Board FQBN is `arduino:avr:mega` (works for Mega and Mega 2560).
- Sketches are auto-discovered as every `sketches/<name>/<name>.ino`.
- The Mega port auto-detects the same way the Python runtime scripts do — by USB VID, explicitly skipping the ODrive.
- Shared headers under `sketches/common/` are added to the compiler's `-I` search path, so any sketch can `#include "cart_limits.h"` without caring where the build dir ends up.
- `compile-only` is safe on a plugged-in Jetson — nothing is flashed unless upload is requested.
- One-time setup on a new machine: `brew install arduino-cli`; the script installs the `arduino:avr` core on demand.

## Cross-cutting: limits stay mirrored between Python and C

Two files, one truth:

- [`limits.py`](../limits.py) — everything Python imports.
- [`sketches/common/cart_limits.h`](../sketches/common/cart_limits.h) — what every Arduino sketch `#include`s.

When pot calibration or steering limits change, **edit both** or one side will silently trust numbers the other has stopped believing.

## Open TODOs (architecture-scope)

- [ ] Execute the `cart/` package refactor described above in a single PR.
- [ ] Add `tests/` with pytest coverage for pure-logic pieces (`effective_gas_cap`, steering conversions, trigger deadzone).
- [ ] Wire the software e-stop from Mega → Jetson so the ODrive gets idled when the Arduino reports an e-stop event (see [`estop.md`](./estop.md)).
- [ ] Stable physical-camera ↔ logical-name mapping so USB enumeration order stops mattering (see [`cameras.md`](./cameras.md)).
